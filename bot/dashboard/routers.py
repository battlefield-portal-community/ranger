class HandleTrailingSlashRouter(APIRouter):
    """
    Registers endpoints for both a non-trailing-slash and a trailing slash. In regards to the exported API schema only the non-trailing slash will be included.

    Examples:

        @router.get("", include_in_schema=False) - not included in the OpenAPI schema, responds to both the naked url (no slash) and /

        @router.get("/some/path") - included in the OpenAPI schema as /some/path, responds to both /some/path and /some/path/

        @router.get("/some/path/") - included in the OpenAPI schema as /some/path, responds to both /some/path and /some/path/
